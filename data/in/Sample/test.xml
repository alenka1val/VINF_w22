'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. It calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. It is usually described alongside [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[History of socialism|socialist movement]] and as having a historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].

The [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[skepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent, and utopian.

== Etymology, terminology and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}
{{see also|Glossary of anarchism}}
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (i.e. &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539.{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary|2005|loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use ''libertarianism'' to refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}
# The will for a non-coercive society.
# The rejection of the state apparatus.
# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.
# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

During the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the [[Muslim world]] or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[Anarchism and religion#Religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions|religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|Adams|2014|pp=33–63}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century—[[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimizing the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War of 1936]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxism|Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] before his expulsion by the Marxists]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]]) opposed Marxist [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

At the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups, and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune, favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]]—despite concerns—in opposition to the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[Communist party|communist parties]], which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]], left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-war era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[Rojava]] supports efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]
At the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism, such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[New Left]], and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]], as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]],{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} and the established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]], and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''[[ad hoc]]'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]], and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity group]]s, and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern [[Syria]].{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[Anarchist schools of thought]] have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the post-classical currents (such as [[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]] and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2019|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]], which holds that the state lacks [[Morality|moral legitimacy]], without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]], but argues that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}}

One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for [[toleration]] and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=1–6}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], and [[libertarian]] interpretations of the [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=12|ps=: &quot;[A]narchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;}} of [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guerin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;|ps=: &quot;The anarchists were unanimous in subjecting authoritarian socialism to a barrage of severe criticism. At the time when they made violent and satirical attacks these were not entirely well founded, for those to whom they were addressed were either primitive or 'vulgar' communists, whose thought had not yet been fertilized by Marxist humanism, or else, in the case of Marx and Engels themselves, were not as set on authority and state control as the anarchists made out.&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many [[History of anarchism|anarchist types and traditions]] exist, and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the primary proponent of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|anarcho-mutualism]], who influenced many future [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchist]] thinkers{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|p=216-218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[Anarcho-communism|communist]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2019|p=2}}

[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Its aims include [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]], and [[Monetary reform|credit and currency reform]] that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property&quot;.{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187|ps=.

[[Collectivist anarchism]], also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism,{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution,{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]], but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990|2ps=: &quot;[The Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.&quot;}} [[Anarcho-communism]], also known as anarchist-communism, communist anarchism, and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]], and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal network]] of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]],{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]].{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}}

[[Anarcho-syndicalism]], also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}}  Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Jarach]] (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right), two prominent [[Contemporary anarchism|contemporary anarchist]] authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a noted advocate of [[post-left anarchy]]]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalization movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence, although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements—at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Perlin|1979}} The [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core. As a result, commentators describe multiple &quot;anarchisms&quot; (rather than a singular &quot;anarchism&quot;) in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. For example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarchist communists]].{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism&quot;.{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} However, anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals—first, to oppose [[the Establishment]]; and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means, and aims to change society through evolutionary means.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics [[Nonviolence|reject violence]] and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era tactics ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists. Pictured is [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[assassination of William McKinley|assassinating U.S. President William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces (as in [[Spain]] and [[Ukraine]]) but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifists]] point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017}} On the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or even acts of terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago; seeing the state as a [[tyrant]], some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[Strike action|strikes]], although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[Reformism|reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[Naturism|nudism]]. They also built communities which were based on [[friendship]]. They were also involved in the [[News media|press]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary tactics ===
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, today's anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]] or [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]]. Μilitant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} However, anarchists not only clash with state operators; they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[Post-World War II anti-fascism|anti-fascist action]] and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary tactics ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Often, decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[Horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy, and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. The newly coined term &quot;small-a anarchism&quot;, in contrast with the &quot;big-A anarchism&quot; of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to Kropotkin or Proudhon to justify their opinions. They would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small [[Affinity group|affinity anarchist groups]] play a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values, or ethics. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]]; these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=119–121}}

Anarchists have gone [[World Wide Web|online]] to spread their message. As in the past, newspapers and journals are used; however, because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where [[surrealism]], poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs, and is also seen an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics, and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[Carnivalesque|carnivalesque atmosphere]] that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|p=37–38}}

== Key issues ==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, and disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. For instance, the compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|1ps=: &quot;In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists.&quot;|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|3ps=: &quot;The philosophy of 'anarcho-capitalism' dreamed up by the 'libertarian' [[New Right]], has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.&quot;|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|4ps=: &quot;'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.&quot;|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53|5ps=: &quot;It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism).&quot;}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]], [[collectivism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality and free love ===
{{main|Free love}}
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] propounded the virtues of [[free love]] in the [[Anarchism in France|Parisian anarchist milieu]] of the early 20th century]]
Gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]; in contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love, though, was much broader; it included critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists, and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States. Some anarchists, however, struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, were pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]], but were nonetheless supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]], radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement (and being influenced as well). By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[Third-wave feminism|third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, which yielded a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} However, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was, therefore, dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider 'proper' education, which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin|Willian Godwin]] and [[Max Stirner]] attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222|3ps=. Max Stirner recorded his thoughts in an essay on education titled &quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;. William Godwin's thoughts can be found in his ''[[Political Justice]]''.}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Ferrer movement|Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system, which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process, and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. His ideas, however, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]] also established a similar school, with its founding principle, according to Tolstoy, being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free&quot;.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518|ps=. For more, see Tolstoy essay's ''Education and Culture''.}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely, without manipulation, ought to be respected, and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions. However, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation; Ferrer, for example, believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty, and social justice were not possible under capitalism (along with other critiques of nationalism and government).{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=519–522}}{{sfn|Avrich|1980|pp=3–33}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers (such as [[Colin Ward]], [[Herbert Read]] and [[Paul Goodman]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[Consumerism|consumer society]].{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists, such as [[Colin Ward]], have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio-economic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526|ps=. Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools; Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England; and Paideia School in Spain.}}

=== Anarchism and the state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction, due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

=== Anarchism and art ===
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]]. 19th century [[Neo-Impressionism|neo-impressionist movement]] had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In this specific painting, note how the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]{{See also|Anarchism and the arts}}The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era, such as futurists, surrealists, and others,{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[Neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfn|AllMusic}} Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read argued that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism, and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas, Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}}

Throughout the 20th century many prominent Anarchists, such as Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, Gustav Landauer, and Camillo Berneri, and publications, such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'', wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|A. Miller|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists: It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies; it could serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society, and also it could turn into a means of direct action, in protests for example. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the &quot;whole human&quot; and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}}

== Criticism{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==
The most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and a state is necessary for human survival.{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}} Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, noting that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}}

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. Fiala's other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world (i.e. at protests) but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically; this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory since while it advocates for no-one to ''archiei'', if accepted by the many, then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism, of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia, following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations'' (1979).{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles, which he finds fallacious; Edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe a normal state{{ambiguous|date=June 2020}} a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion, and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}}

Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] notes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}}

'''Apollo 11''' was the [[Human spaceflight|spaceflight]] that first [[Moon landing|landed]] humans on the [[Moon]]. Commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and lunar module pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] formed the American crew that landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and they collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to [[Earth]]. Command module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] flew the [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']] alone in [[lunar orbit]] while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named [[Tranquility Base]] before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module.

== Background ==

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the [[Cold War]], a geopolitical rivalry with the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=134}} On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[Satellite|artificial satellite]]. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic and technological superiority.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=13–15}} This precipitated the [[Sputnik crisis]], and triggered the [[Space Race]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=1}} [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and initiating [[Project Mercury]],{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101–106}} which aimed to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}} But on April 12, 1961, Soviet [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=332–333}} Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower's successor, [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=121}}

Since the Soviet Union had higher lift capacity [[launch vehicle]]s, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=112–117}}

On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the [[United States Congress]] on &quot;Urgent National Needs&quot; and declared:{{quote|I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations—explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moon—if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there. |source=Kennedy's speech to Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/jfk_speech_text.html |title=Excerpt: 'Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs' |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 16, 2018|date=May 25, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 12, 1962, Kennedy [[We choose to go to the Moon|delivered another speech]] before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice University football stadium]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/49181/rt050i01.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title='Visiting Professor' Kennedy Pushes Space Age Spending|last=Keilen|first=Eugene|date=September 19, 1962|newspaper=The Rice Thresher|access-date=March 11, 2018|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2012/08/30/jfks-1962-moon-speech-still-appeals-50-years-later/|title=JFK's 1962 Moon Speech Still Appeals 50 Years Later|last=Boyd|first=Jade|date=August 30, 2012|publisher=Rice University|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows:

{{quote|There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all.

In spite of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a &quot;[[Boondoggle|moondoggle]]&quot; by [[Norbert Wiener]], a mathematician at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-you-didnt-know-about-apollo-11-mission-fifty-years-ago-180972165/|title=What You Didn't Know About the Apollo 11 Mission|last=Fishman|first=Charles|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=June 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/moondoggle-the-forgotten-opposition-to-the-apollo-program/262254/|title=Moondoggle: The Forgotten Opposition to the Apollo Program|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=September 12, 2012|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=June 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: [[Project Apollo]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=15}} When Kennedy met with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]] in June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev did not take up the offer.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}} Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the Moon in a speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 20, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-046-041.aspx |access-date=March 11, 2018 |title=Address at 18th U.N.

An early and crucial decision was choosing [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] over both [[direct ascent]] and [[Earth orbit rendezvous]]. A [[space rendezvous]] is an [[orbital maneuver]] in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. In July 1962 NASA head [[James E. Webb|James Webb]] announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program|date=December 1992|access-date=December 26, 2018|publisher=NASA|work=NASA Langley Research Center Office of Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=85–86}} and that the [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] would have three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=72–77}} This design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single [[Saturn V]] rocket that was then under development.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=48–49}}

Technologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by [[Project Gemini]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=181–182, 205–208}} The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances in [[semiconductor]] [[electronic technology]], including [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs) in the [[Interplanetary Monitoring Platform]] (IMP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Interplanetary Monitoring Platform |date=August 29, 1989 |publisher=[[NASA]] |pages=1, 11, 134 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800012928.pdf |accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=H.

Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the [[Apollo 1]] fire on January 27, 1967, in which astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] died, and the subsequent investigation.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=214–218}} In October 1968, [[Apollo 7]] evaluated the command module in Earth orbit,{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=265–272}} and in December [[Apollo 8]] tested it in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=274–284}} In March 1969, [[Apollo 9]] put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit,{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=292–300}} and in May [[Apollo 10]] conducted a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=303–312}}

The Soviet Union competed with the US in the Space Race, but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 launcher]], which was comparable to the Saturn V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |title=The Soviet Manned Lunar Program |last=Lindroos |first=Marcus |work=[[MIT OpenCourseWare]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of [[Uncrewed spacecraft|uncrewed probes]]. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 15]], which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in [[Mare Crisium]] about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The [[Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories]] radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Recording tracks Russia's Moon gatecrash attempt |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/recording-tracks-russias-moon-gatecrash-attempt-1730851.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial crew assignment of Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot (CMP) [[Jim Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the backup crew for Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=374}} Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of [[Gemini 12]]. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and Apollo{{nbsp}}9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo{{nbsp}}8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}}

There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], the CMP on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288–289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [[Fred Haise]] filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}} Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} the first being Apollo 10.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=72}} The next was [[STS-26]] in 1988.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}}

[[Deke Slayton]] gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually [[Apollo 13]]).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=338–339}}

The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of [[Apollo 12]]. Instead they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=434–435}} Aldrin and Collins described the crew as &quot;amiable strangers&quot;.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}} Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said &quot;...&amp;nbsp;all the crews I was on worked very well together.&quot;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}}

=== Backup crew ===

{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology  = Astronaut
|position1    = Commander
|crew1_up     = [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell Jr.]]
|position2    = Command Module Pilot

|position3    = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up     = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise Jr.]]
}}

The backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, [[William Anders]] as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo{{nbsp}}8.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} In early 1969, he accepted a job with the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]] effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}}

By the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly on [[Apollo 14]] after backing up for Apollo 11. Later, Lovell's crew was forced to switch places with [[Alan Shepard]]'s tentative [[Apollo 13]] crew to give Shepard more training time.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}}

=== Support crew ===

During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and [[William R. Pogue|Bill Pogue]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=375}}

The [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the [[Christopher C.

The Apollo 11 [[Mission patch|mission emblem]] was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for &quot;peaceful lunar landing by the United States&quot;. At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the [[bald eagle]], the [[national bird]] of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an [[olive branch]] in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that &quot;eleven&quot; would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with &quot;Apollo 11&quot;,{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332–334}} and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would &quot;be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=332}}

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs [[Julian Scheer]] wrote to [[George M. Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the MSC, to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name ''Snowcone'' was used for the CM and ''Haystack'' was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.{{sfn|Marshall Space Flight Center|1969|p=8}}

The LM was named ''[[Lunar Module Eagle|Eagle]]'' after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer's suggestion, the CM was named ''[[Command Module Columbia|Columbia]]'' after ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. It also referred to [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], a historical name of the United States. {{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=334–335}}{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=331}} In Collins' 1976 book, he said ''Columbia'' was in reference to [[Christopher Columbus]].{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=116}}

NASA's Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the [[Lunar Orbiter program]] and information about surface conditions provided by the [[Surveyor program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-lunar-landing-sites-selected |title=50 Years Ago: Lunar Landing Sites Selected |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 22, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=79}} The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=19}}

Areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=98–99}} Five sites were considered: Sites{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were in the Sea of Tranquility (''[[Mare Tranquillitatis]]''); Site{{nbsp}}3 was in the Central Bay (''[[Sinus Medii]]''); and Sites{{nbsp}}4 and{{nbsp}}5 were in the Ocean of Storms (''[[Oceanus Procellarum]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt;
The final site selection was based on seven criteria:
* The site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;
* with approach paths free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;
* reachable with a minimum amount of propellant;
* allowing for delays in the launch countdown;
* providing the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;
* with good visibility during the landing approach, meaning the Sun would be between 7{{nbsp}}and 20 degrees behind the LM; and
* a general slope of less than two degrees in the landing area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt;

The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt; A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=7}} The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site{{nbsp}}2, with Sites 3{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10's lunar module flew to within {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} of Site{{nbsp}}2, and reported it was acceptable.{{sfn|Cappellari|1972|p=976}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/orbital-missions/apollo10-facts.cfm|title=Apollo 10|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=December 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First-step decision ===
During the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, &quot;Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?&quot;{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=148}}{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=360}} Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was &quot;not based on individual desire&quot;.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=148}}

One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions,{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=347}} where the commander had never performed the spacewalk.{{sfn|Aldrin|Abraham|2016|pp=57–58}} Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=363–365}}

For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=149}} Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, &quot;Yes, that's the way to do it.&quot;{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=150}}

The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=281}} [[Chris Kraft]] revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like [[Charles Lindbergh]], a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=371–372}}

Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 [[UTC]] (9:32:00 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission Overview&quot; /&gt; At 13.2 seconds into the flight, the launch vehicle began to [[Roll program|roll]] into its [[flight azimuth]] of 72.058°. Full shutdown of the first-stage engines occurred about 2{{nbsp}}minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines. The second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9{{nbsp}}minutes and 8{{nbsp}}seconds, allowing the first ignition of the S-IVB engine a few seconds later.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}}

Apollo 11 entered a [[elliptic orbit|near-circular Earth orbit]] at an altitude of {{convert|100.4|nmi|km}} by {{convert|98.9|nmi|km}}, twelve minutes into its flight. After one and a half orbits, a second ignition of the S-IVB engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver was performed. This involved separating ''Columbia'' from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with ''Eagle'' still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=374–375}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}} This was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon.

At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']], and began the final preparations for lunar descent.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}} At 17:44:00 ''Eagle'' separated from ''Columbia''.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=107}} Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=9}}{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=209}} Armstrong exclaimed: &quot;The ''Eagle'' has wings!&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=209}}

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were &quot;long&quot;; they would land miles west of their target point. ''Eagle'' was traveling too fast. The problem could have been [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]—concentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel. Or it could have been the result of ''Eagle''{{'}}s pirouette maneuver.{{sfn|Mindell|2008|pp=220–221}}{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=82}}

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the Moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM guidance computer]] (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer [[Jack Garman]] told [[Flight controller#GUIDO|Guidance Officer]] [[Steve Bales]] it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated &quot;executive overflows&quot;, meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|pp=210–212}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Hackler|2008|pp=34–43}} [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]], the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the [[MIT]] [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory]] later recalled:

During the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=190–192}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html |title=Apollo 11: 25 Years Later |last=Martin |first=Fred H. |date=July 1994 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software engineer [[Don Eyles]] concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed LM in [[Apollo 5]]. Having the rendezvous radar on (so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious [[cycle stealing]], as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm |title=Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer |last=Eyles |first=Don |date=February 6, 2004 |work=27th annual Guidance and Control Conference |publisher=[[American Astronautical Society]] |location=Breckenridge, Colorado |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landing ===
[[File:AP11 FINAL APPROACH.ogv|thumb|Landing on the Moon, July 20, 1969]]
When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|sp=us|-diameter}} crater (later determined to be [[West (lunar crater)|West crater]]), so he took semi-automatic control.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=196}}{{sfn|Mindell|2008|pp=195–197}} Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting ''Eagle''. Now {{convert|107|ft|m|sp=us}} above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=197}}

Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now {{convert|250|ft|m|sp=us}} above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now {{convert|100|ft|m|sp=us}} from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM's engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft's motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft's speed.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|pp=198–199}}

A light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle''{{'s}} footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said: &quot;Contact light!&quot; Armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine's own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode, but he forgot. Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong shut the engine down.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=199}} Aldrin immediately said &quot;Okay, engine stop. ACA—out of [[detent]].&quot; Armstrong acknowledged: &quot;Out of detent. Auto.&quot; Aldrin continued: &quot;Mode control—both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm—off. 413 is in.&quot;{{sfn|Mindell|2008|p=226}}
[[File:Apollo 11 Landing Site &amp; West Crater.png|thumb|left|Landing site relative to [[West (lunar crater)|West crater]]]]
ACA was the [[Attitude control|Attitude Control Assembly]]—the LM's control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the [[reaction control system]] (RCS) jets to fire. &quot;Out of Detent&quot; meant the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. LGC address 413 contained the variable that indicated the LM had landed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

''Eagle'' landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with {{convert|216|lb}} of usable fuel remaining. Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe,&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=295}} but post-mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horizons2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fjeld |first1=Paul |title=The Biggest Myth about the First Moon Landing |journal=Horizons |date=June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=5–6 |url=http://www.aiaahouston.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Horizons_2013_05_and_06_low_resolution.pdf#page=5 |accessdate=March 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning.

On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with &quot;Engine arm is off&quot;, before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, &quot;Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed.&quot; Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot; emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |type=TV production |title=Failure is Not an Option |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |date=August 24, 2003 |oclc=54435670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: &quot;Roger, Twan—Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:
{{quote|This is the LM pilot.

He then took [[Eucharist|communion]] privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis]]) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [[Webster, Texas|Webster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|pp=204, 623}} The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=21–22}}

Preparations for [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] to walk on the Moon began at 23:43.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=107}} These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=22}} Six hours and thirty-nine minutes after landing Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and ''Eagle'' was depressurized.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=215}}

{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Frase de Neil Armstrong.ogg|title=That's one small step ...|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

While still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:

At the behest of the [[Nixon administration]] to add a reference to God, NASA included the vague date as a reason to include A.D., which stands for [[Anno Domini]], &quot;in the year of our Lord&quot; (although it should have been placed before the year, not after).{{sfn|Gardner|2017|p=143}}

Armstrong intended to say &quot;That's one small step for a man&quot;, but the word &quot;a&quot; is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said &quot;for a man&quot;, and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the &quot;a&quot; in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words &quot;for a&quot; together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the &quot;a&quot; may have been spoken but obscured by static. Other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as &quot;face-saving fabrication&quot;, and that Armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{snopes | link = http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp | title = One Small Step}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong 'got Moon quote right' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5398560.stm |date=October 2, 2006 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong's 'poetic' slip on Moon |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |authorlink=Pallab Ghosh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8081817.stm |date=June 3, 2009 |work=BBC News |location=London |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/10010.pdf |title=Lunar Sample Compendium: Contingency Soil (10010) |last=Meyer |first=Charles |date=2009 |work=Astromaterials Research &amp; Exploration Science |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve minutes after the sample was collected,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=108}} he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a [[Hasselblad]] camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong's [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Apollo space suit]].{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=23}} Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: &quot;Magnificent desolation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt;

Armstrong said moving in the [[Gravitation of the Moon|lunar gravity]], one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;even perhaps easier than the simulations&amp;nbsp;... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle''{{'s}} shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=23}}
[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|left|Aldrin salutes the deployed United States flag on the [[lunar surface]]]]

The astronauts planted the [[Lunar Flag Assembly]] containing a [[flag of the United States]] on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, &quot;Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theattic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Flag on the Moon |url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/9/27/4j6861bez3j568c31rzj7lynevmtpt |website=The Attic |accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole about {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=|order=flip}} into the hard lunar surface.

=== Lunar ascent ===

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing {{convert|21.55|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html |title=Trying to Rest |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |date=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon.

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=108}} Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine.

=== ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit ===

During his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said &quot;not since [[Adam]] has any human known such solitude&quot;,{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: &quot;this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while ''Columbia'' passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather &quot;awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}}

One of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about {{convert|4|mile|km}} off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the [[fuel cell]]s and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=401–407}}

Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of ''Columbia'' might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When ''Columbia'' came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as &quot;relaxing&quot;. After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for ''Eagle'' to meet up with ''Columbia'', Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly ''Columbia'' down to meet ''Eagle''.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=406–408, 410}}

''Eagle'' rendezvoused with ''Columbia'' at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''{{'s}} orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001125211/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |archivedate=October 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: {{quote|&amp;nbsp;... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly&amp;nbsp;... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people&amp;nbsp;... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}}}}
Aldrin added: {{quote|This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown&amp;nbsp;... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. &quot;When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Psalm|8:3–4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Armstrong concluded: {{quote|The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}} }}

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later |last=Rodriguez |first=Rachel |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |work=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Splashdown and quarantine ===

[[File:Splashdown 3.jpg|thumb|''Columbia'' floats on the ocean as Navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts]]

The [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, under the command of [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Carl J. Seiberlich]],{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|p=3}} was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing its sister ship, the [[Landing platform helicopter|LPH]] {{USS|Princeton|LPH-5|6}}, which had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. ''Hornet'' was then at her home port of [[Long Beach, California]].{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|p=21}} On reaching [[Pearl Harbor]] on July 5, ''Hornet'' [[Embarkation|embarked]] the [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]] helicopters of [[HS-4]], a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make room, most of ''Hornet''{{'}}s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command module used for training.{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|pp=38–43, 71–72}}

On July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, ''Hornet'' departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific,{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|p=85}} in the vicinity of {{Coord|10|36|N|172|24|E|display=inline}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11_PressKit.pdf |title=Press Kit—Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Mission |publisher=NASA |p=57 |date=July 6, 1969 |access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] flew to [[Johnston Atoll]] on [[Air Force One]], then to the [[command ship]] {{USS|Arlington|AGMR-2|6}} in [[Marine One]]. After a night on board, they would fly to ''Hornet'' in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard ''Hornet'', the party was greeted by the [[United States Pacific Command|Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC)]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[John S. McCain Jr.]], and [[NASA Administrator]] [[Thomas O. Paine]], who flew to ''Hornet'' from [[Pago Pago]] in one of ''Hornet''{{'}}s [[carrier onboard delivery]] aircraft.{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|pp=107–108, 145–146}}

Weather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Hank Brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper-level winds which &quot;would have ripped their parachutes to shreds&quot; according to Brandli; posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2013/October%202013/1013weather.aspx|title=Weather or Not|website=Air Force Magazine|access-date=July 22, 2019|date=October 2013|last1=Richelson|first1=Jeffrey T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Fleet Weather Center]] at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Donald C. Davis]], commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific, advised NASA to change the recovery area, each man risking their careers. A new location was selected {{convert|215|nmi|km}} northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ Re-entry&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|pp=136–137, 144–145}}

This altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned they would not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ Re-entry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/26day9-reentry.html |publisher=Apollo Flight Journal |title=Day 9: Re-entry and Splashdown |via=NASA |first1=W.

Before dawn on July 24, ''Hornet'' launched four Sea King helicopters and three [[Grumman E-1 Tracer]]s. Two of the E-1s were designated as &quot;air boss&quot; while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=169–170}} At 16:44 UTC (05:44 local time) ''Columbia''{{'}}s [[drogue parachute]]s were deployed.

The divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution and ''Columbia'' wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board ''Hornet''. The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=164–167}}

After touchdown on ''Hornet'' at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the {{convert|30|ft|m}} to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|pp=199–200}} This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and [[Apollo 14]], before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped.{{sfn|Johnston|Dietlein|Berry|1975|pp=406–424}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s5ch1.htm|title=The Lunar Quarantine Program|id=SP-368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth.

After Nixon departed, ''Hornet'' was brought alongside the {{convert|5|ST|adj=on}} ''Columbia'', which was lifted aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a [[Dolly (trailer)|dolly]] and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. ''Hornet'' returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]] and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] at 10:00 UTC on July 28. ''Columbia'' was taken to [[Ford Island]] for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to [[Hickham Air Force Base]], from whence it was flown to Houston in a [[Douglas C-133 Cargomaster]], reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=166, 171–173}}

{{main|Apollo 11 in popular culture}}
Humans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy's goal set eight years earlier.

While most people celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=283}} This is not to say they were not awed by it.

Twenty percent of the world's population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Launius&quot; /&gt; One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy's goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|p=58}} A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch14-7.html|title=Where No Man Has Gone Before: A History of Apollo Lunar Exploration Missions|journal=NASA Special Publication|volume=494|pages=420|last1=Compton|first1=William David|bibcode=1989NASSP.494..420C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/space-exploration/apollo-11|title=Apollo 11|publisher=History|date=August 23, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Americans were proud of their nation's achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the [[Gallup Poll]] indicate that a majority of Americans favored &quot;doing more&quot; in space as opposed to &quot;doing less&quot;. By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had ended, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of [[détente]]. This was also a time when [[inflation]] was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned [[Caspar Weinberger]], the deputy director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], might send a signal that &quot;our best years are behind us&quot;.{{sfn|McCurdy|1997|pp=106–107}}

After the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated they were not making an attempt.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=631}} [[Mstislav Keldysh]] said in July 1969, &quot;We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems.&quot; It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/18/us/russians-finally-admit-they-lost-race-to-moon.html|title=Russians Finally Admit They Lost Race to Moon|last1=Wilford|first1=John Noble|date=December 18, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public's reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/apollo-moon-khrushchev/|title=The Moon Landing through Soviet Eyes: A Q&amp;A with Sergei Khrushchev, son of former premier Nikita Khrushchev|magazine=Scientific American|date=July 16, 2009|access-date=January 7, 2019|last1=Das|first1=Saswato R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs &quot;Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins&quot; by [[The Byrds]] on the 1969 album ''[[Ballad of Easy Rider (album)|Ballad of Easy Rider]]'' and &quot;Coon on the Moon&quot; by [[Howlin' Wolf]] on the 1973 album ''The Back Door Wolf''.

The descent stage of the LM ''Eagle'' remains on the Moon. In 2009, the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html |title=LRO Sees Apollo Landing Sites |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 25, 2018|date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface, after being abandoned and impacting the Moon. The location is uncertain because ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/spacecraft/location/lm.cfm?dom=pscau |title=Location of Apollo Lunar Modules |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moon rocks ===

The main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in [[Houston, Texas]]. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at [[White Sands Test Facility]] near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples, and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lun-fac.cfm |title=Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://world.wng.org/2016/09/the_mystery_of_the_missing_moon_rocks |title=The mystery of the missing Moon rocks |publisher=World |first=Kristen |last=Flavin |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation [[Apollo 11 lunar sample display]]s for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50&amp;nbsp;mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a [[Half dollar (United States coin)|United States half dollar coin]]. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. The Apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by Nixon in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html |title=Where today are the Apollo 11 goodwill lunar sample displays? |first1=Robert |last1=Pearlman |authorlink=Robert Pearlman |publisher=collectSPACE |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Earth'' magazine, March 2011, pp. 42–51&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2019, the Mint released the [[Apollo 11 Fiftieth Anniversary commemorative coins]] to the public on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|114|282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs/commemorative-coins/apollo-11-50th-anniversary|title=Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Program|website=United States Mint|access-date=February 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film, ''[[Apollo 11 (2019 film)|Apollo 11]]'', with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in [[IMAX]] on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kenny |first=Glenn |title='Apollo 11' Review: The 1969 Moon Mission Still Has the Power to Thrill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/movies/apollo-11-review.html |date=February 27, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/apollo-11-documentary-imax-release-1203138469/|title='Apollo 11' Documentary Gets Exclusive Imax Release|magazine=Variety|date=February 13, 2019|last1=Rubin|first1=Rebecca|access-date=September 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Institute's [[National Air and Space Museum]] and [[NASA]] sponsored the &quot;Apollo 50 Festival&quot; on the [[National Mall]] in Washington DC. The three day (July 18 to 20, 2019) outdoor festival featured hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as [[Adam Savage]] and NASA scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/apollo-50-festival|title=Apollo 50 Festival|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo 11 projected on the washington monument.jpg|upright|thumb|Saturn V rocket projected onto the [[Washington Monument]] during the Apollo 11 50th anniversary show]]

As part of the festival, a projection of the {{Convert|363|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Saturn V]] rocket was displayed on the east face of the {{Convert|555|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Washington Monument]] from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30{{Nbsp}}pm until 11:30{{Nbsp}}pm (EDT). The program also included a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. The projection was joined by a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wide recreation of the [[Kennedy Space Center]] countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing. There were three shows per night on July 19–20, with the last show on Saturday, delayed slightly so the portion where Armstrong first set foot on the Moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/go-for-the-moon|title=Apollo 50 Go For the Moon|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
